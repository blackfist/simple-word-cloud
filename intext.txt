2012 DATA BREACH INVESTIGATIONS REPORT A study conducted by the Verizon RISK Team with cooperation from the Australian Federal Police, Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit, Irish Reporting and Information Security Service, Police Central e-Crime Unit, and United States Secret Service. 2012 DBIR: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2011 will almost certainly go down as a year of civil and cultural uprising. Citizens revolted, challenged, and even overthrew their governments in a domino effect that has since been coined the “Arab Spring,” though it stretched beyond a single season. Those disgruntled by what they perceived as the wealth-mongering “1%”, occupied Wall Street along with other cities and venues across the globe. There is no shortage of other examples. This unrest that so typified 2011 was not, however, constrained to the physical world. The online world was rife with the clashing of ideals, taking the form of activism, protests, retaliation, and pranks. While these activities encompassed more than data breaches (e.g., DDoS attacks), the theft of corporate and personal information was certainly a core tactic. This re-imagined and re-invigorated specter of “hacktivism” rose to haunt organizations around the world. Many, troubled by the shadowy nature of its origins and proclivity to embarrass victims, found this trend more frightening than other threats, whether real or imagined. Doubly concerning for many organizations and executives was that target selection by these groups didn’t follow the logical lines of who has money and/or valuable information. Enemies are even scarier when you can’t predict their behavior. It wasn’t all protest and lulz, however. Mainline cybercriminals continued to automate and streamline their method du jour of high-volume, low-risk attacks against weaker targets. Much less frequent, but arguably more damaging, were continued attacks targeting trade secrets, classified information, and other intellectual property. We certainly encountered many faces, varied tactics, and diverse motives in the past year, and in many ways, the 2012 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) is a recounting of the many facets of corporate data theft. 855 incidents, 174 million compromised records. This year our DBIR includes more incidents, derived from more contributors, and represents a broader and more diverse geographical scope. The number of compromised records across these incidents skyrocketed back up to 174 million after reaching an all-time low (or high, depending on your point of view) in last year’s report of four million. In fact, 2011 boasts the second-highest data loss total since we started keeping track in 2004. This re-imagined and re-invigorated specter of “hacktivism” rose to haunt organizations around the world. 1 2 Once again, we are proud to announce that the United States Secret Service (USSS) and the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) have joined us for this year’s report. We also welcome the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the Irish Reporting & Information Security Service (IRISS), and the Police Central eCrimes Unit (PCeU) of the London Metropolitan Police. These organizations have broadened the scope of the DBIR tremendously with regard to data breaches around the globe. We heartily thank them all for their spirit of cooperation, and sincerely hope this report serves to increase awareness of cybercrime, as well as our collective ability to fight it. With the addition of Verizon’s 2011 caseload and data contributed from the organizations listed above, the DBIR series now spans eight years, well over 2000 breaches, and greater than one billion compromised records. It’s been a fascinating and informative journey, and we are grateful that many of you have chosen to come along for the ride. As always, our goal is that the data and analysis presented in this report prove helpful to the planning and security efforts of our readers. We begin with a few highlights below. DATA COLLECTION The underlying methodology used by Verizon remains relatively unchanged from previous years. All results are based on first-hand evidence collected during paid external forensic investigations conducted by Verizon from 2004 to 2011. The USSS, NHTCU, AFP, IRISS, and PCeU differed in precisely how they collected data contributed for this report, but they shared the same basic approach. All leveraged VERIS as the common denominator but used varying mechanisms for data entry. From the numerous investigations worked by these organizations in 2011, in alignment with the focus of the DBIR, the scope was narrowed to only those involving confirmed organizational data breaches. A BRIEF PRIMER ON VERIS VERIS is a framework designed to provide a common language for describing security incidents in a structured and repeatable manner. It takes the narrative of “who did what to what (or whom) with what result” and translates it into the kind of data you see presented in this report. Because many readers asked about the methodology behind the DBIR and because we hope to facilitate more information sharing on security incidents, we have released VERIS for free public use. A brief overview of VERIS is available on our website1 and the complete framework can be obtained from the VERIS community wiki.2 Both are good companion references to this report for understanding terminology and context. 1 http://www.verizonbusiness.com/resources/whitepapers/wp_verizon-incident-sharing-metrics-framework_en_xg.pdf 2 https://verisframework.wiki.zoho.com/ These organizations have broadened the scope of the DBIR tremendously with regard to data breaches around the globe. We heartily thank them all for their spirit of cooperation, and sincerely hope this report serves to increase awareness of cybercrime, as well as our collective ability to fight it. 3 SUMMARY STATISTICS WHO IS BEHIND DATA BREACHES? 98% stemmed from external agents (+6%) No big surprise here; outsiders are still dominating the scene of corporate data theft. Organized criminals were up to their typical misdeeds and were behind the majority of breaches in 2011. Activist groups created their fair share of misery and mayhem last year as well—and they stole more data than any other group. Their entrance onto the stage also served to change the landscape somewhat with regard to the motivations behind breaches. While good old-fashioned greed and avarice were still the prime movers, ideological dissent and schadenfreude took a more prominent role across the caseload. As one might expect with such a rise in external attackers, the proportion of insider incidents declined yet again this year to a comparatively scant 4%. 4% implicated internal employees (-13%) <1% committed by business partners (<>) 58% of all data theft tied to activist groups HOW DO BREACHES OCCUR? Incidents involving hacking and malware were both up considerably last year, with hacking linked to almost all compromised records. This makes sense, as these threat actions remain the favored tools of external agents, who, as described above, were behind most breaches. Many attacks continue to thwart or circumvent authentication by combining stolen or guessed credentials (to gain access) with backdoors (to retain access). Fewer ATM and gas pump skimming cases this year served to lower the ratio of physical attacks in this report. Given the drop in internal agents, the misuse category had no choice but to go down as well. Social tactics fell a little, but were responsible for a large amount of data loss. 81% utilized some form of hacking (+31%) 69% incorporated malware (+20%) 10% involved physical attacks (-19%) 7% employed social tactics (-4%) 5% resulted from privilege misuse (-12%) WHAT COMMONALITIES EXIST? 79% of victims were targets of opportunity (-4%) Findings from the past year continue to show that target selection is based more on opportunity than on choice. Most victims fell prey because they were found to possess an (often easily) exploitable weakness rather than because they were pre-identified for attack. Whether targeted or not, the great majority of victims succumbed to attacks that cannot be described as highly difficult. Those that were on the more sophisticated side usually exhibited this trait in later stages of the attack after initial access was gained. Given this, it’s not surprising that most breaches were avoidable (at least in hindsight) without difficult or expensive countermeasures. Low levels of PCI DSS adherence highlight a plethora of issues across the board for related organizations. While at least some evidence of breaches often exists, victims don’t usually discover their own incidents. Third parties usually clue them in, and, unfortunately, that typically happens weeks or months down the road. Did you notice how most of these got worse in 2011? 96% of attacks were not highly difficult (+4%) 94% of all data compromised involved servers (+18%) 85% of breaches took weeks or more to discover (+6%) 92% of incidents were discovered by a third party (+6%) 97% of breaches were avoidable through simple or intermediate controls (+1%) 96% of victims subject to PCI DSS had not achievedcompliance (+7%) WHERE SHOULD MITIGATION EFFORTSBE FOCUSED? Once again, this study reminds us that our profession has the necessary tools to get the job done. The challenge for the good guys lies in selecting the right tools for the job at hand and then not letting them get dull and rusty over time. Evidence shows when that happens, the bad guys are quick to take advantage of it. As you’ll soon see, we contrast findings for smaller and larger organizations throughout this report. You will get a sense for how very different (and in some cases how very similar) their problems tend to be. Because of this, it makes sense that the solutions to these problems are different as well. Thus, most of the recommendations given at the end of this report relate to larger organizations. It’s not that we’re ignoring the smaller guys—it’s just that while modern cybercrime is a plague upon their house, the antidote is fairly simple and almost universal. Larger organizations exhibit a more diverse set of issues that must be addressed through an equally diverse set of corrective actions. We hope the findings in this report help to prioritize those efforts, but truly tailoring a treatment strategy to your needs requires an informed and introspective assessment of your unique threat landscape. Smaller organizations Implement a firewall or ACL on remote access services Change default credentials of POS systems and other Internet-facing devices If a third party vendor is handling the two items above, make sure they’ve actually done them Larger organizations Eliminate unnecessary data; keep tabs on what’s left Ensure essential controls are met; regularly check that they remain so Monitor and mine event logs Evaluate your threat landscape to prioritize your treatment strategy Refer to the conclusion of this report for indicators and mitigators for the most common threats THREAT EVENT OVERVIEW In last year’s DBIR, we presented the VERIS threat event grid populated with frequency counts for the first time. Other than new data sharing partners, it was one of the most well received features of the report. The statistics throughout this report provide separate analysis of the Agents, Actions, Assets, and Attributes observed, but the grid presented here ties it all together to show intersections between the 4 A’s. It gives a single big-picture view of the threat events associated with data breaches in 2011. Figure 1 (overall dataset) and Figure 2 (larger orgs) use the structure of Figure 1 from the Methodology section in the full report, but replace TE#s with the total number of breaches in which each threat event was part of the incident scenario3. This is our most consolidated view of the 855 data breaches analyzed this year, and there are several things worth noting. When we observe the overall dataset from a threat management perspective, only 40 of the 315 possible threat events have values greater than zero (13%). Before going further, we need to restate that not all intersections in the grid are feasible. Readers should also remember that this report focuses solely on data breaches. During engagements where we have worked with organizations to “VERIS-ize” all their security incidents over the course of a year, it’s quite interesting to see how different these grids look when compared to DBIR datasets. As one might theorize, Error and Misuse as well as Availability losses prove much more common. 3 In other words, 381 of the 855 breaches in 2011 involved external malware that affected the confidentiality of a server (the top left threat event). The results for the overall dataset share many similarities with our last report. The biggest changes are that hotspots in the Misuse and Physical areas are a little cooler, while Malware and Hacking against Servers and User Devices are burning brighter than ever. Now back to the grids, where the results for the overall dataset share many similarities with our last report. The biggest changes are that hotspots in the Misuse and Physical areas are a little cooler, while Malware and Hacking against Servers and User Devices are burning brighter than ever. Similarly, the list of top threat events in Table 3 in the full report feels eerily familiar. Separating the threat events for larger organizations in Figure 2 yields a few additional talking points. Some might be surprised that this version of the grid is less “covered” than Figure 1 (22 of the 315 events – 7% – were seen at least once). One would expect that the bigger attack surface and stronger controls associated with larger organizations would spread attacks over a greater portion of the grid. This may be true, and our results shouldn’t be used to contradict that point. We believe the lower density of Figure 2 compared to Figure 1 is mostly a result of size differences in the datasets (855 versus 60 breaches). With respect to threat diversity, it’s interesting that the grid for larger organizations shows a comparatively more even distribution across in-scope threat events (i.e., less extreme clumping around Malware and Hacking). Based on descriptions in the press of prominent attacks leveraging forms of social engineering and the like, this isn’t a shocker. Figure 1.

It also provides additional information on the data collection methodology for Verizon and the other contributors. 2012 DBIR: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS This year, we’re including something new in this section. However, being the environmentally conscious group that we are, we’re going to recycle this blurb one more time: “Creating a list of solid recommendations gets progressively more difficult every year we publish this report. Think about it; our findings shift and evolve over time but rarely are they completely new or unexpected. Why would it be any different for recommendations based on those findings? Sure, we could wing it and prattle off a lengthy list of to-dos to meet a quota but we figure you can get that elsewhere. We’re more interested in having merit than having many.” Then, we’re going to reduce and reuse some of the material we included back in the 2009 Supplemental DBIR, and recast it in a slightly different way that we hope is helpful. As mentioned, we’ve also produced something new, but made sure it had a small carbon (and page space) footprint. If you combine that with the energy saved by avoiding investigator travel, shipping evidence, and untold computational cycles, these recommendations really earn their “green” badge. Figure 2.

We’re talking about the smaller organizations that have one (or a handful) of POS systems. The cutout below was created especially for them and we need your help. We invite you, our reader, to cut it out, and give it to restaurants, retailers, hotels, or other establishments that you frequent. In so doing, you’re helping to spread a message that they need to hear. Not to mention, it’s a message that the rest of us need them to hear too. These tips may seem simple, but all the evidence at our disposal suggests a huge chunk of the problem for smaller businesses would be knocked out if they were widely adopted. Figure 3.

You were given this card because someone likes your establishment. They wanted to help protect your business as well as their payment and personal information. It may be easy to think “that’ll never happen to me” when it comes to hackers stealing your information. But you might be surprised to know that most attacks are directed against small companies and most can be prevented with a few small and relatively easy steps. Below you’ll find a few tips based on Verizon’s research into thousands of security breaches affecting companies like yours that use point-of-sale (POS) systems to process customer payments. If none of it makes sense to you, please pass it on to management. 9 9 Change administrative passwords on all POS systems – – Hackers are scanning the Internet for easily guessable passwords. 9 9 Implement a firewall or access control list on remote access/administration services – – If hackers can’t reach your system, they can’t easily steal from it. After that, you may also wish to consider these: • Avoid using POS systems to browse the web (or anything else on the Internet for that matter) • Make sure your POS is a PCI DSS compliant application (ask your vendor) If a third-party vendor looks after your POS systems, we recommend asking them to confirm that these things have been done. If possible, obtain documentation. Following these simple practices will save a lot of wasted money, time, and other troubles for your business and your customers. For more information, visit www.verizon.com/enterprise/databreach (but not from your POS). For those who don’t remember (tsk, tsk), the 2009 Supplemental DBIR was an encyclopedia of sorts for the top threat actions observed back then. Each entry contained a description, associated threat agents, related assets, commonalities, indicators, mitigators, and a case study. To provide relevant and actionable recommendations to larger organizations this year, we’re repurposing the “indicators” and “mitigators” part from that report. • Indicators: Warning signs and controls that can detect or indicate that a threat action is underway orhas occurred. • Mitigators: Controls that can deter or prevent threat actions or aid recovery/response (contain damage)in the wake of their occurrence. Our recommendations will be driven off of Table 7 in the full report, which is in the Threat Action Overview section, and shows the top ten threat actions against larger organizations. Rather than repeat the whole list here, we’ll summarize the points we think represent the largest opportunities to reduce our collective exposure to loss: • Keyloggers and the use of stolen credentials • Backdoors and command control • Tampering • Pretexting • Phishing • Brute force • SQL injection Hacking: Use of stolen credentials Description Refers to instances in which an attacker gains access to a protected system or device using valid but stolen credentials. Indicators Presence of malware on system; user behavioral analysis indicating anomalies (i.e., abnormal source location or logon time); use of “last logon” banner (can indicate unauthorized access); monitor all administrative/privileged activity. Mitigators Two-factor authentication; change passwords upon suspicion of theft; time-of-use rules; IP blacklisting (consider blocking large address blocks/regions if they have no legitimate business purpose); restrict administrative connections (i.e., only from specific internal sources). For preventing stolen credentials, see Keyloggers and Spyware, Pretexting, and Phishing entries. Malware: Backdoors, Command and Control Hacking: Exploitation of backdoor or command and control channel Description Tools that provide remote access to and/or control of infected systems. Backdoor and command/control programs bypass normal authentication mechanisms and other security controls enabled on a system and are designed to run covertly. Indicators Unusual system behavior or performance (several victims noted watching the cursor navigating files without anyone touching the mouse); unusual network activity; IDS/IPS (for non-customized versions); registry monitoring; system process monitoring; routine log monitoring; presence of other malware on system; AV disabled. During investigations involving suspected malware we commonly examine active system processes and create a list of all system contents sorted by creation/modification date. These efforts often reveal malicious files in the Windows\system32 and user temporary directories. Malware: Backdoors, Command and Control Hacking: Exploitation of backdoor or command and control channel Mitigators Egress filtering (these tools often operate via odd ports, protocols, and services); use of proxies for outbound traffic; IP blacklisting (consider blocking large address blocks/regions if they have no legitimate business purpose); host IDS (HIDS) or integrity monitoring; restrict user administrative rights; personal firewalls; data loss prevention (DLP) tools; anti-virus and anti-spyware (although increased customization rendering AV less effective—we discovered one backdoor recognized by only one of forty AV vendors we tried); web browsing policies. Physical: Tampering Description Unauthorized altering or interfering with the normal state or operation of an asset. Refers to physical forms of tampering rather than, for instance, altering software or system settings. Indicators An unplanned or unscheduled servicing of the device. Presence of scratches, adhesive residue, holes for cameras, or an overlay on keypads. Don’t expect tampering to be obvious (overlay skimmers may be custom made to blend in with a specific device while internal tampering may not be visible from the outside). Tamper-proof seal may be broken. In some cases an unknown Bluetooth signal may be present and persist. Keep in mind that ATM/gas skimmers may only be in place for hours, not days or weeks. Mitigators Train employees and customers to look for and detect signs of tampering. Organizations operating such devices should conduct examinations throughout the day (e.g., as part of shift change). As inspection occurs, keep in mind that if the device takes a card and a PIN, that both are generally targeted (see indicators). Set up and train all staff on a procedure for service technicians, be sure it includes a method to schedule, and authenticate the technician and/or maintenance vendors. Push vendor for anti-tamper technology/features or only purchase POS and PIN devices with anti-tamper technology (e.g., tamper switches that zero out the memory, epoxy covered electronics). Keylogger/Form-grabber/Spyware Description Malware that is specifically designed to collect, monitor, and log the actions of a system user. Typically used to collect usernames and passwords as part of a larger attack scenario. Also used to capture payment card information on compromised POS devices. Most run covertly to avoid alerting the user that their actions are being monitored. Indicators Unusual system behavior or performance; unusual network activity; IDS/IPS (for noncustomized versions); registry monitoring; system process monitoring; routine log monitoring; presence of other malware on system; signs of physical tampering (e.g., attachment of foreign device). For indicators that harvested credentials are in use, see Unauthorized access via stolen credentials. During investigations involving suspected malware we commonly examine active system processes and create a list of all system contents sorted by creation/modification date. These efforts often reveal malicious files in the Windows\system32 and user temporary directories. Keylogger/Form-grabber/Spyware Mitigators Restrict user administrative rights; code signing; use of live boot CDs; onetime passwords; anti-virus and anti-spyware; personal firewalls; web content filtering and blacklisting; egress filtering (these tools often send data out via odd ports, protocols, and services); host IDS (HIDS) or integrity monitoring; web browsing policies; security awareness training; network segmentation. Pretexting (Social Engineering) Description A social engineering technique in which the attacker invents a scenario to persuade, manipulate, or trick the target into performing an action or divulging information. These attacks exploit “bugs in human hardware” and, unfortunately, there is no patch for this. Indicators Very difficult to detect as it is designed to exploit human weaknesses and bypasses technological alerting mechanisms. Unusual communication, requests outside of normal workflow, and instructions to provide information or take actions contrary to policies should be viewed as suspect. Call logs; visitor logs; e-mail logs. Mitigators General security awareness training; clearly defined policies and procedures; do not “train” staff to ignore policies through official actions that violate them; train staff to recognize and report suspected pretexting attempts; verify suspect requests through trusted methods and channels; restrict corporate directories (and similar sources of information) from public access. Brute-force attack Description An automated process of iterating through possible username/password combinations until one is successful. Indicators Routine log monitoring; numerous failed login attempts (especially those indicating widespread sequential guessing); help desk calls for account lockouts. Mitigators Technical means of enforcing password policies (length, complexity, clipping levels); account lockouts (after x tries); password throttling (increasing lag after successive failed logins); password cracking tests; access control lists; restrict administrative connections (i.e., only from specific internal sources); two-factor authentication; CAPTCHA. SQL injection Description SQL Injection is an attack technique used to exploit how web pages communicate with back-end databases. An attacker can issue commands (in the form of specially crafted SQL statements) to a database using input fields on a website. Indicators Routine log monitoring (especially web server and database); IDS/IPS. Mitigators Secure development practices; input validation (escaping and whitelisting techniques); use of parameterized and/or stored procedures; adhere to principles of least privilege for database accounts; removal of unnecessary services; system hardening; disable output of database error messages to the client; application vulnerability scanning; penetration testing; web application firewall.  Unauthorized access via default credentials Description Refers to instances in which an attacker gains access to a system or device protected by standard preset (and therefore widely known) usernames and passwords. Indicators User behavioral analysis (e.g., abnormal logon time or source location); monitor all administrative/privileged activity (including third parties); use of “last logon” banner(can indicate unauthorized access). Mitigators Change default credentials (prior to deployment); delete or disable default account; scan for known default passwords (following deployment); password rotation (because it helps enforce change from default); inventory of remote administrative services (especially those used by third parties). For third parties: contracts (stipulating password requirements); consider sharing administrative duties; scan for known default passwords (for assets supported by third parties).  Phishing (and endless *ishing variations) Description A social engineering technique in which an attacker uses fraudulent electronic communication (usually e-mail) to lure the recipient into divulging information. Most appear to come from a legitimate entity and contain authentic-looking content. The attack often incorporates a fraudulent website component as well as the lure. Indicators Difficult to detect given the quasi-technical nature and ability to exploit human weaknesses. Unsolicited and unusual communication; instructions to provide information or take actions contrary to policies; requests outside of normal workflow; poor grammar; a false sense of urgency; e-mail logs. Mitigators General security awareness training; clearly defined policies and procedures; do not “train” staff to ignore policies through official actions that violate them; policies regarding use of e-mail for administrative functions (e.g., password change requests, etc.); train staff to recognize and report suspected phishing messages; verify suspect requests through trusted methods and channels; configure e-mail clients to render HTML e-mails as text; anti-spam; e-mail attachment virus checking and filtering. verizon.com/enterprise © 2012 Verizon.
